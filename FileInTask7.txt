An object that may hold resources (such as file or socket handles) until it is closed.
The close() method of an AutoCloseable object is called automatically when exiting a try-with-resources block for which the object has been declared in the resource specification header.
This construction ensures prompt release, avoiding resource exhaustion exceptions and errors that may otherwise occur.
